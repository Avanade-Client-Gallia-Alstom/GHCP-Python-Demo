#create a Python script that monitors the CPU usage of a system continuously. If the CPU usage exceeds a specified threshold, the script should send an email alert. You plan to utilize the psutil library for monitoring CPU usage and the smtplib library for sending email alerts. Additionally, you want the script to print the current CPU usage each time it checks. Configure the script to allow users to set the monitoring interval, CPU usage threshold, and email settings within the script itself.
